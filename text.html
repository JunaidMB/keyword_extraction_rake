O <strong style='color:red'>People</strong>, <strong style='color:red'>lend</strong> me an <strong style='color:red'>attentive ear</strong>, for I know not whether after this <strong style='color:red'>year</strong>, I shall ever be amongst you again. Therefore <strong style='color:red'>listen</strong> to what I am saying to you very carefully and take these words to those who could not be present here today.O <strong style='color:red'>people</strong>, just as you <strong style='color:red'>regard</strong> this month, this day, this city as <strong style='color:red'>Sacred</strong>, so <strong style='color:red'>regard</strong> the life and property of every <strong style='color:red'>Muslim</strong> as a <strong style='color:red'>sacred</strong> trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. <strong style='color:red'>Hurt</strong> no one so that no one may <strong style='color:red'>hurt</strong> you. Remember that you will indeed meet your Lord, and that He will indeed reckon your deeds. <strong style='color:red'>Allah</strong> has forbidden you to take usury (interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. <strong style='color:red'>Allah</strong> has Judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to Abbas ibn Abd Al-Muttalib (Prophet’s uncle) shall henceforth be waived…Beware of Satan, for the safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things, so <strong style='color:red'>beware</strong> of following him in small things.O <strong style='color:red'>people</strong>, it is true that you have certain rights with <strong style='color:red'>regard</strong> to your women, but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under Allah’s trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well as never to be unchaste.O <strong style='color:red'>people</strong>, <strong style='color:red'>listen</strong> to me in earnest, worship <strong style='color:red'>Allah</strong>, say your five daily prayers (Salah), fast during the month of Ramadan, and give your wealth in Zakat. Perform Hajj if you can afford to.All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an <strong style='color:red'>Arab</strong> has no <strong style='color:red'>superiority</strong> over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any <strong style='color:red'>superiority</strong> over an <strong style='color:red'>Arab</strong>; also a white has no <strong style='color:red'>superiority</strong> over black nor a black has any <strong style='color:red'>superiority</strong> over white except bypiety (taqwa) and good action. Learn that every <strong style='color:red'>Muslim</strong> is a brother to every <strong style='color:red'>Muslim</strong> and that the <strong style='color:red'>Muslims constitute</strong> one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a <strong style='color:red'>Muslim</strong> which belongs to a fellow <strong style='color:red'>Muslim</strong> unless it was given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, do injustice to yourselves.Remember, one day you will appear before <strong style='color:red'>Allah</strong> and answer your deeds. So <strong style='color:red'>beware</strong>, do not stray from the path of righteousness after I am gone.O <strong style='color:red'>people</strong>, no <strong style='color:red'>prophet</strong> or apostle will come after me and no new faith will be born.Reason well, therefore, O <strong style='color:red'>people</strong>, and understand words which I convey to you. I leave behind me two things, the Qu'ran and my example, the Sunnah and if you follow these you will never go astray.All those who <strong style='color:red'>listen</strong> to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who <strong style='color:red'>listen</strong> to me directly. Be my witness, O <strong style='color:red'>Allah</strong>, that I have conveyed your message to your <strong style='color:red'>people</strong>.
